# PRD: Lintic

Open-source, self-hostable platform that replaces traditional coding assessments with agentic AI workflow evaluations. Candidates get a browser-based IDE with an AI coding agent and open-ended prompts. Companies configure constraints (token budgets, interaction limits) and simulated infrastructure (Redis, Postgres, message queues). The platform records sessions and computes structured metrics on human-AI collaboration quality.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Database: SQLite (via better-sqlite3) for Docker/local, PostgreSQL (via pg) for serverless/cloud. Abstract via DatabaseAdapter interface.
- Code Runtime: WebContainers (@webcontainer/api)
- Agent Communication: Agent Interface Protocol (internal REST API)
- Deployment: Docker, docker-compose
- Configuration: YAML (js-yaml)
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)

## Quality Gates

These commands must pass for every user story:
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - ESLint
- `npm run test` - Vitest unit tests

### US-007a: Agent tool definitions and executor

**Description:** As a developer, I need a set of tool definitions that give the LLM the ability to read files, write files, run terminal commands, and browse the file system inside the candidate's WebContainer, so the agent can act on the codebase directly rather than just chatting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Maximum of 10 tool calls per candidate message to prevent runaway loops
- [ ] Each tool call and result is recorded in the session for replay
- [ ] The candidate sees tool actions streaming in the chat panel (e.g., "Reading src/index.ts...", "Running npm test...", "Writing src/utils.ts...")
- [ ] Token usage from all LLM calls in the loop counts toward the session budget
- [ ] If a tool call fails, the error is passed back to the LLM so it can recover
- [ ] Unit tests for the loop termination conditions and token accounting
- [ ] Typecheck passes

### US-007c: Tool action display in chat UI
